# Week 10 Sets and Maps - Baby Name Commonality Finder

## Objective

The Week 10 Sets and Maps project was designed to read a text file containing baby name rankings and identify names that are common to both boys and girls. The program uses `HashSet` to store unique names, identifies intersections, and displays a sorted list of common names.

### Skills Learned

- Using Java `Set` collections (`HashSet`) to store unique elements.
- Reading data from files using `Scanner`.
- Performing set operations such as intersection (`retainAll`) to find common elements.
- Sorting a collection using `ArrayList` and `Collections.sort()`.
- Handling exceptions for file input (`FileNotFoundException`).

### Tools Used

- Java programming language.
- `HashSet` and `ArrayList` for data storage and manipulation.
- `Scanner` for reading from files and user input.
- File I/O with proper exception handling.
